# Drowsy Driver Detector
The aim of our project was to demonstrate and test a system which could detect whether a driver is drowsy by using an array of sensors (two in our case). The data from these sensors is then processed by comparing it to a data base or our model. We managed to get operational two sensors. One monitors the drivers steering patterns to detect sudden jerky movements which our research suggested was symptomatic of drowsiness. The other sensor is a camera setup which monitors the number of blinks and the duration of these blinks over a period of time, and is capable of operating in low light conditions, since the earlier and morning and night are the times when most incidents involving drowsiness occur. This was also found to be an accurate indication of drowsiness. We hoped that by combining the results from both sensors it would give an accurate picture of the state of the driver. The data gathered and processed from both sensors was accurate and given the cost of the items and the ubiquity of availability, we believe that the growing awareness of law makers and the general public to the risks associated with drowsy driving give this system commercial viability.
